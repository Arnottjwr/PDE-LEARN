# This file defines the PDE that we search for. PDE-LEARN can identify
# PDEs of the following form:
#     T_0(U) = c_1 T_1(U) + ... + c_n T_n(U)
# Here, U is the PDE solution (which depends on (t, x), (t, x, y), or
# (t, x, y, z), depending on the number of PDE terms). F_0, ... , F_K are scalar
# valued functions of U (NOT its derivatives). Each T_k is a "term", which is
# an expression of the form
#     T_k(u) = (D^{(1)} u)^{p(1)} (D^{(2)} u)^(p(2)} ... (D^{(n)} u)^{p(n)}.
# Here, D^{(0)}, ... , D^{(n)} are partial derivative operators, and p(1), ... ,
# p(n) are non-negative integers. We call an expression of the form
# D^{(2)} u)^(p(2)}) a "sub-term". We call T_0 the "left-hand side term" or
# "LHS Term" for short, and the terms T_1, ... , T_n the "right-hand side terms"
# or "RHS terms" for short.
#
# This file specifies terms. Since the LHS term is special, we specify it
# separately. Each term must go on a single line. Each term should be expressed
# as a sequence of sub-terms, with a * between each sub-term (the * is
# essential, as we use it to split each line).
#
# Each sub-term should be expressed as a derivative, followed by the letter "u"
# or "U", all surrounded in a set of parenthesis, raised to a power. A
# derivative should be expressed as a sequence of partial derivatives. Each
# partial derivative should be of the form D_s (for first order derivatives) or
# D_s^k (for higher order derivatives). There should be a space between each
# partial derivative. For example, D_t D_x^2 D_y. The derivative should come
# before the "u" or "U", with a space between the two. A carrot, ^, should
# follow the closing parenthesis and immediately be followed by a non-negative
# integer. If a sub-term's power is 1, you can drop the parenthesis and the ^1.
# Thus, all three of the following represent the sub-term "U",
#     U
#     (U)
#     (U)^1
# The following means "second x partial and first y partial of U, raised to the
# 4th power":
#      (D_x^2 D_t U )^4
# If a sub-term has no derivative (D^{(i)} = 1), then you simply do not list
# one. For example, the following line specifies the sub-term U^2,
#       (U)^2
# Here is an example term which represents (dU/dx)*U,
#     (D_x U)*(U)
# The first term you specify is the LHS term. There can be blank lines,
# comments, etc between terms. The only rules are that the terms adhere to the
# format above and that there is at most one term per line.

# LHS Term
(D_x^2 D_y U)^3 * (D_t U)^2

# RHS Terms

D_x U
D_x^2 U
